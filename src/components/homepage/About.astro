            <p>
                Hi! We are Spark Strategies: a team of Business Consultants, Strategists and
                Marketing Minds with one goal: to help women of the wellness world STOP undervaluing themselves and their businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                We help our entrepreneurs think bigger, work smarter and create improved commercial
                success so they can enjoy the financial freedom to live out their life dreams -
                whatever those dreams may be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spark Strategies was founded by Nicole D'Andrea in 2018. As a successful studio
                owner herself, she uncovered a deep need for professionalization in the wellness
                world - especially amongst women. So, she leveraged her strategic sixth sense,
                first-hand experience and bigger vision for the industry to help others build and
                sustain profitable businesses of their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                To date, we've served hundreds of boutique fitness studios. Our consulting business
                is our means of empowering others to grow their mindsets AND their bottom lines.
            </p>
            <p>Ready to thrive? We can't wait to meet you.</p>
